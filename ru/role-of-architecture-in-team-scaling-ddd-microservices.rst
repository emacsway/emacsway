    Adding manpower to a late software project makes it later."

    -- The Brooks's Law

    üìù "Brooks' law is based on the idea that communications overhead is a significant factor on software projects, and that work on a software project is not easily partitioned into isolated, independent tasks. Ten people can pick cotton ten times as fast as one person because the work is almost perfectly partitionable, requiring little communication or coordination. But nine women can't have a baby any faster than one woman can because the work is not partitionable. Brooks argues that work on a software project is more like having a baby than picking cotton. When new staff are brought into a late project, they aren't immediately productive, and they must be trained. The staff who must train them are already productive, but they lose productivity while they're training new staff. Brooks argues that, on balance, more effort is lost to training and additional coordination and communications overhead than is gained when the new staff eventually becomes productive."
